My todo list is an automatic event reminder app. 
Inputs: Users can type the notice showed in the future and the date when this notice will pop up. 
Outputs: Notice will be showed one day before the date that users input early. 
Data types in my todo list include strings， numbers， and boolean values. All notice and date can be input as strings. Then the date will be transfor to miliseconds in order to calculate how long it will take to pop up this notice.
